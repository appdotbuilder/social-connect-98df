  // 1. Finding all accepted friends of the user
  // 2. Querying posts from those friends (and optionally the user's own posts)
  // 3. Including user information, like counts, comment counts
  // 4. Including whether the current user liked each post
  // 5. Ordering by created_at descending (newest first)
  // 6. Applying pagination with limit and offset
